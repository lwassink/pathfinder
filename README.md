# pathfinder

This repository will contain my work on a pathfinder program.
The goal of this program is to track the initiative rounds of pcs and npcs and their initiative order.
Future goals include
  --A GUI
  --Role dice for npc attacks and other actions
  --a database of npcs and monsters
  --save and load npcs
  --save and load game configurations
